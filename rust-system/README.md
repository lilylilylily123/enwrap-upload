# Rust File Upload System
This is a simple file upload system written in Rust. It uses the standard library, with no external crates.

## Usage
Once Rust is installed, simpy `cargo run` and visit `http://0.0.0.0:1234/upload` with a POST request containing a file.

Make sure you have a folder called `storage` in the same parent directory as the `src` folder.


## Warning

This was my first time using Rust, so the code is probably not very idiomatic. I also have no idea if this is secure or not, so use at your own risk.
